# Tree Data Model & Algorithms

This document details how conversation versions and turns are represented, branched, and visualized in `dsh-tree-view`.

---

## 1. Dual-Level Representation

There are two distinct levels of data representation in the system:

1. **Storage Level (Session DAG)**:
   - DSH enforces session-level isolation. Each branch is a distinct DSH session record with `parentSession`, `isSeeded`, and a separate `inheritedEventCount`.
   - The host maintains durable `message-tree/version` markers detailing which turn was edited/retried and what changed.

2. **Presentation Level (Turn-Level Branching Tree)**:
   - A user thinks of conversation branching at the **message/turn** level, not the session container level.
   - `buildTurnTree` projects the session versions into individual turn nodes.

```
Session DAG (Storage):
Session A (Original)  ──[edit turn 1]──>  Session B (Fork)

Turn Tree (Visualization):
               [Root Conversation]
                 /             \
        [A: Turn 1 (1/2)]    [B: Turn 1 (2/2) - Edited]
               |                    |
        [A: Turn 2]          [B: Turn 2]
```

## 2. Core Algorithms

### 2.1 Turn Tree Construction (`buildTurnTree`)
*Location: [`lib/tree-logic.js`](../lib/tree-logic.js#L173), [`plugin.client.js`](../plugin.client.js#L415)*

Transforms `versions` into an array of turn nodes:
1. **Root Conversation Node (`${rootSessionId}#root`)**: Represents the origin anchor of the conversation.
2. **Root Session Turns**:
   - Turn 1 hangs off `${rootSessionId}#root`.
   - Turn $k$ ($k > 1$) hangs off `${rootSessionId}#t${k-1}`.
3. **Forked Session Turns**:
   - For a session branched at `targetTurn = T`:
     - If $T = 1$: Turn 1 hangs off `${rootSessionId}#root` (sibling of the original Turn 1).
     - If $T > 1$: Turn $T$ hangs off `${parentSessionId}#t${T-1}` (sibling of parent's Turn $T$).
     - Subsequent turns $T+1, T+2, \dots$ hang off the previous turn in the same session (`${sessionId}#t${k-1}`).
4. **Safety Fallback**: Any node whose computed `parentId` does not exist in the graph is automatically attached to `${rootSessionId}#root`, preventing disconnected subtrees.

### 2.2 Sibling Fan-Out (`attachParentId`)
*Location: [`lib/tree-logic.js`](../lib/tree-logic.js#L9)*

When a user edits Turn 1 repeatedly (e.g. Turn 1 $\rightarrow$ Edit 1 $\rightarrow$ Edit 2 while viewing Edit 1):
- Without fan-out, edits form a chain: $A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C$.
- `attachParentId` traverses up versions of the same turn and stops at the first session that is *not* an edit of that turn ($A$).
- Result: Both Edit 1 and Edit 2 hang off $A$ as sibling branches.

### 2.3 Ghost Ancestor Recovery (`ancestorChainFromLog` & `collectFamily`)
*Location: [`lib/tree-logic.js`](../lib/tree-logic.js#L110-L171)*

If an intermediate session in a family is deleted by the user in DSH:
- The deleted session's own event log is gone.
- However, its descendant sessions inherited its prefix log (including the `message-tree/version` marker describing the deleted parent).
- `ancestorChainFromLog` inspects the surviving descendant's seed events to reconstruct deleted ancestors as **ghost nodes** (`deleted: true`).
- `collectFamily` ensures the family graph remains fully connected even when intermediate nodes are deleted.

### 2.4 Active Path Calculation
*Location: [`lib/tree-logic.js`](../lib/tree-logic.js#L318-L339)*

To highlight only the active branch path without highlighting superseded sibling branches:
1. Locate the latest turn node in `currentSessionId`.
2. Walk upwards following `parentId` pointers until reaching `${rootSessionId}#root`.
3. Mark only nodes on this walk with `onCurrentPath = true`.

### 2.5 Bubble Version Ring (`ringFor`)
*Location: [`lib/tree-logic.js`](../lib/tree-logic.js#L30-L68)*

Calculates the `‹ n/m ›` counter under a message at `turn` while viewing `sessionId`:
- Walks parent links to find the common fork point for that turn.
- Filters out deleted/ghost sessions (renumbering over surviving versions).
- Returns `{ alternatives, index }`. If fewer than 2 alternatives exist, returns `null` (counter is hidden).

### 2.6 Long-Stretch Folding (`foldLongRuns`)
*Location: [`plugin.client.js`](../plugin.client.js)*

A deep family can spend most of its canvas on turns that decide nothing. A turn with
**exactly one child** is a pass-through: the line simply continues. A run of them can be
hundreds of world units long, and there are two kinds:

- the **shared history** above the first fork (every branch below still contains it), and
- the **unbranched run** any single branch continues on afterwards.

Both fold. A run is bordered by the nodes that do matter, and those always stay drawn:
the origin (`#root`), where the branches part (two or more children), where the line ends,
and the latest turn of the session being read — so the place you are adding to is never
hidden inside a fold.

- Each run is replaced by one synthetic node, `id = <first hidden turn>#fold`, carrying
  `fold: true`, `foldCount`, `foldShared` (true only for the origin's own run) and the
  turn range it hides. Its parent is the turn *before* the run, and the run's exit
  re-parents onto it, so the chain stays connected and no card is orphaned into its own root.
- Because every hidden node has exactly one child by construction, no other node can hang
  off a hidden one; a fold cannot create a dangling parent.
- A fold inherits `current` / `onCurrentPath` only when **all** the turns it hides are on
  that line, so "the line you are reading" keeps reading as one line.
- The threshold is **per run** (`foldSharedAt`, default 8 hidden turns; 0 disables it), so a
  short run next to a long one stays drawn. The same threshold governs the toolbar control,
  which only expands and re-folds what the setting already allows — a control that folded
  shorter runs than the setting was folding three-turn runs out of nowhere. `foldModes`
  remembers "expanded" per family for the page.
- How it is drawn: three sheets offset down-right — a stack of turns with the top one
  labelled — one line of text, a chevron saying it opens, and a box taller than a bar so it
  holds its own beside a turn card. Solid border, no dashes: a fold is not a broken link.
  Colour comes from `currentColor`, so an accent fold on the line you are reading stays
  accent and the rest stay neutral.
- Folding is a client-side view decision, not a data change: `buildTurnTree` still returns
  the full tree, and `foldLongRuns(nodes, threshold)` is applied on top of it.
- Expanding or collapsing re-frames the canvas once. The request is a ref
  (`fitAfterLayoutRef`), set by the fold action and consumed by the layout effect **after** the
  new positions exist — fitting at click time would frame the layout being replaced. On a real
  family the difference is not subtle: one click took its tree from 40 cards at scale 0.46 to
  757 cards at scale 0.03.

### 2.7 Version Switch = Main-Chat Swap (`swapOnVersionSwitch`)
*Location: [`plugin.client.js`](../plugin.client.js)*

Versions are whole sessions, and exactly one of them is the conversation's entry in the
sidebar. Switching versions swaps which one that is, and archive membership is what
expresses it — there is no extra state:

- Target **collected in the tree** (archived): bring it out (`activate`) and put the version
  you were reading away (`demote`). The conversation keeps one entry, and it follows you.
- Target **already in the main chat** (not archived): just open it. Nothing is archived and
  nothing is brought out — the reader put it there on purpose.
- Target **is the version on screen**: not a switch at all. Only the Chat tab is brought
  forward and the turn is flashed; no archive call of either kind is made.

Called from the two switches the reader makes on purpose: a node click in the tree and the
`‹ ›` ring under a bubble. The chat view's session transition deliberately does **not**
collect, so a fork, a sidebar click or the last-viewed-version restore cannot archive
anything behind the reader's back. Two protections remain on the version being collected: an
archived one has nothing to collect, and one that is still generating a reply is skipped,
because archiving mid-turn would hide work that is still arriving.

### 2.8 Subagent Sessions in a Family (`subagent`)

*Location: [`lib/index.js`](../lib/index.js)*

A subagent session is a **child session** of the conversation that spawned it: `origin:
'subagent'` in its header, `parentSession` pointing at the conversation, `delegationDepth` one
per level, and — the part that matters here — **the same `cwd`**. The family walk keys on
exactly those two things (same cwd, reachable through `parentSession`), so a subagent
conversation is swept into the family and drawn as if it were a version of the reader's
message. It has no `message-tree/version` marker, which is the only hint the client had.

Measured on this machine: 29 subagent sessions across 7 workspaces, one conversation with
four of them. So the host says what it knows and the client marks it:

- the payload carries `subagent: true` (from `header.origin`), plus `delegationDepth` when it
  is nested deeper than one level;
- every node of that version inherits the flag, so a card carries `data-subagent` and a
  `subagent` tag on its top edge — the same tag the subtitle repeats in words.

Nothing about placement changes: the version is still drawn where the walk put it. Hiding or
collapsing subagent conversations is a separate decision, not taken here.

### 2.9 Archived Versions Are Still Versions

*Location: [`lib/index.js`](../lib/index.js)*

Archiving (by this plugin's "collect into the tree", or by DSH's own archive) only takes a
session **out of the sidebar**. It is not a delete, and the tree is where a conversation's
versions live, so every version the family walk finds is drawn — archived ones with
`archived: true`, which the client renders dimmed and marked 已归档, and whose context menu
offers "move to main chat".

This used to be a filter: an archived version was drawn only if the tree itself had collected
it (`state.demoted`) or something still descended from it. That rule existed for
dsh-sidenote, which forks a session for a side chat and archives it to keep the sidebar clean —
but it also hid the reader's own forks: a fork made at turn 44 and archived by hand was
invisible in the tree, with no way back. A side chat, if such a plugin returns, now shows up as
an archived branch instead: visible, dimmed, and reversible.

### 2.10 Tagged Turns

*Location: lib/tree-state.js, lib/index.js*

A tag is the reader's own mark on a turn, written from the assistant action row in
the Chat view. It lives in the sidecar beside branch names and archive membership
— never in the session log — because it is a note about a conversation, not part
of one.

Two keys are involved, and they are not the same:

- **Stored by message id.** The action row hands its entries one durable message
  id: the FINAL assistant message of the turn, and nothing else. So the sidecar's
  tag map is keyed by that id, which is also what makes the toggle a single
  lookup for the button.
- **Drawn by turn.** The tree is a turn graph. The host indexes every identified
  surface message to its turn while parsing the log (messageTurnsIn, cached with
  the parse) and intersects that with the tag store when it builds the payload:
  each version's turns carry their own tag, and the payload also carries
  messageTags keyed by message, which is what the action row reads.

Because the tag is resolved through the log, a tag on a message inside a shared
prefix appears on the turn node the tree actually draws, not on copies of it
inside descendants.

Folding treats a tagged turn as a landmark: foldLongRuns refuses to pass through
one, exactly as it already refuses the latest turn of the session being read, so a
fold can never swallow the turn the reader marked.

A tag naming a message the session never wrote is refused at the route with a 400:
the id is checked against that session's own event log before anything is stored.

## 3. Graph Layout & Springs

*Location: [`plugin.client.js`](../plugin.client.js#L567-L612)*

- **Tidy Tree Layout (`layoutTurnTree`)**:
  - Leaf nodes take successive horizontal slots (`cursor * SLOT_X`, where `SLOT_X = 206px`).
  - Parent nodes center horizontally over their children (`(min_x + max_x) / 2`).
  - Depths scale vertically (`depth * SLOT_Y`, where `SLOT_Y = 132px`).
- **Spring Physics (`springs.current`)**:
  - Cards smoothly animate to their target coordinates using critically-damped spring equations ($k = 190, c = 24$).
  - New cards spawn at their parent's coordinates and spring outward.
  - Edges are rendered as cubic SVG bezier curves connecting parent card bottoms to child card tops.
