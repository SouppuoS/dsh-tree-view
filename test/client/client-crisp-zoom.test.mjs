// The bug this guards: the canvas kept `will-change: transform` on the world (and
// on every card) for good. A promoted layer is rasterised once and then stretched
// by the GPU, so zooming in showed the tree scaled up soft instead of redrawn at
// the scale actually on screen.
//
// Measured on the real composited desktop, same card at scale 1.8: the promoted
// render carried 48% less edge energy (12.91 vs 19.09) than the same card after
// the hint is dropped. CDP screenshots cannot see this — they re-rasterise the
// page for the capture, so both renders come out sharp there. That is why this is
// a source-level guard rather than a pixel test.
