**TreeView — use a conversation as a tree**

[简体中文](README.md) | English

Edit an old message and the conversation forks from that turn; every version lives in one tree, and the sidebar keeps a single entry.

**Edit a message you already sent**, or use DSH's own **Branch into a new conversation** button — either way it grows a new branch here:

![The version ring under a user message, with the edit / copy / retry buttons](assets/screenshot-ring.png)

Switch the conversation panel to Tree and the whole family is drawn on one canvas:

## Features

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| 🖱️ **Jump to a branch** | Every node is a real session version; clicking it moves you onto that line. Underneath it is only an archived flag being flipped: the version you clicked is unarchived back into the sidebar, and the one you were reading is archived into the tree — so moving around the tree moves the sidebar slot rather than adding to it. |
| 🔀 **Parallel lines** | A version *is* a session. Right-click and send several of them "back into the main chat" — that step only unarchives, it touches nothing else — and two branches can work at the same time without disturbing each other; collect them again when you are done. |
| 🧹 **One-click collect** | Right-click any node and choose "collect every other branch": it gathers the family's strays into the tree at once, leaving the one you are using. If any of them is still generating a reply it asks first — stop and collect, or cancel — so nothing is killed quietly. |
| 🗂️ **Folding** | A run of turns that is neither the latest nor tagged folds into a single node at the configured length (two by default). A tagged turn and the turn you are reading are never hidden inside one. Hover a fold for an outline of what it hides, and click a row to jump to that turn; the outline also names the files that turn produced, if any, as inline code. The threshold is a setting. |
| 🏷️ **Tagging a turn** | One more control in the assistant action row: click to tag the turn, with an optional Markdown note, and click again to remove it. A tagged turn is drawn in the Tree with an accent border, a badge and its note, and is never hidden inside a fold; tagging also records the HEAD commit of every repository at or under the working directory **at that moment**, shown on the turn's card (read straight out of `.git`, no git binary involved). |
| 🚫 **Hiding empty forks** | Forks that only copied this conversation without adding a turn of their own are not drawn; the switch lives in Settings. |
| ✏️ **Renaming branches** | Right-click a node to name a branch. The sidebar title stays the host's own (`(1)`, `(2)` and all) — only the box drawn in the tree is named. |
| 🔄 **Version ring** | The `‹ n/m ›` ring under a message, to move between versions of the same question without leaving the chat. |
| 🎯 **Highlighted reading path** | The whole line you are reading — shared opening included — is highlighted on the canvas, so where you came from, where you are and where you can still go read off one picture. |
| 📌 **Resume where you left off** | Coming back to this family from another conversation resumes the version you last read (off by default; switchable in Settings). |
| 🤖 **Subagent tags** | A subagent session hanging under this conversation carries a tag, so it is not read as one of your versions. |
| 🕸️ **Cross-session references** | When another conversation (a subagent, say) hands material in, the Tree draws a **dashed arrow** to the turn that went on with it; a sender that is not on the canvas becomes a `⇠ handle` mark on the receiving turn instead, with the runtime's account in its tooltip. |
| 📦 **Archived branches stay** | A version you archive is still drawn, dimmed and marked "archived" — archiving takes an entry out of the sidebar, it does not delete a branch. |
| 🎨 **Following the theme** | Surface, border, accent, state and even shadow colours come from the host's theme tokens: light follows light, dark follows dark. |

## How it works

| Point | Detail |
|---|---|
| **A rewind, not a continuation** | When you edit, the host seeds a new session with every event before that turn and sends the edited prompt into it — the new version restarts from the sentence you changed, with the same working directory and context. DSH's own "Branch into a new conversation" produces the same kind of history-seeded session, and the plugin reads its fork point off the seed length just the same. |
| **Old versions survive** | The original line is still in the tree; one click goes back to it, and both lines can keep going independently. |
| **Nothing collects on your behalf** | Editing, retrying, opening a session from the sidebar and restoring where you last read change no archived flag at all — only picking a version from the tree, or pressing "collect every other branch", does. Otherwise one casual rewording would quietly collect the session you were in. |

## Legend

| On the canvas | What it is |
|---|---|
| The trunk | The opening every version shares — the turns before the first fork |
| A fork | One edit: one side is the original, the other is the rewritten version |
| The highlighted line | The version you are reading, from the start of the conversation to the turn on screen |
| A stack of sheets | A run of consecutive turns folded together |

Pan, zoom with the wheel, click a node to jump there; right-click a node to rename it or to decide whether it lives in the sidebar or in the tree.

## Archive and restore

Archiving is the only switch this plugin touches on your data, so it gets its own section:

- **Into the tree** archives that version out of the DSH sidebar; **back into the main chat** unarchives it. This DSH build ships no unarchive API, so the plugin writes that state the way the archive registry itself does — all of it in `lib/archive-adapter.js`, probed at startup: whatever the host is missing is logged, the affected buttons grey out, and the rest of the tree keeps working.
- **Nothing is deleted, copied or rewritten.** The session log is append-only, and apart from the one `message-tree/version` marker a fork has to write, the plugin adds nothing to it.
- **After uninstalling**, every session is still there; the versions that were collected into the tree can be unarchived from DSH's own archive list. Branch names and "who was collected" live in `~/.dsh/storages/tree-view/state.json` — harmless to keep, and deleting it does not affect any session.

## Install

Install from npm:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-tree-view
```

Or straight from GitHub:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add github:Rice00/dsh-tree-view
```

The patch inserts one row (`tree-view`) into the profile. Then **restart that profile** — host plugin modules are cached in-process, so a running harness will not pick the new row up; UI-only changes just need a page refresh.

Or install a local checkout, to have edits take effect immediately (`link:` is a live link, and the folder must not move afterwards):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rice00/dsh-tree-view.git
dsh plugin --profile web add link:/abs/path/to/dsh-tree-view
```

<details>
<summary>Let an AI assistant do it (copy-paste)</summary>

```
Please install the DSH plugin dsh-tree-view:
1) Into the web profile:
     dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-tree-view                 (npm)
     dsh plugin --profile web add github:Rice00/dsh-tree-view   (GitHub)
     dsh plugin --profile web add link:<absolute-path>          (local checkout)
2) Restart that profile; UI-only changes just need a browser refresh.
3) Verify: a Tree tab in the conversation panel, a TreeView section in Settings.
```

## Versions and compatibility

**1.0.0 freezes the plugin's own surface**: the configuration keys, the three durable formats — the `message-tree/version` marker in the session log (`schemaVersion: 1`), the sidecar store `~/.dsh/storages/tree-view/state.json`, and the browser preference `dsh-tree-view:prefs` (`v: 2`) — and the verified host range below. From here they change only in a major version, and with a migration. A host outside that range is not a broken promise: it calls for a compatibility release.

| DSH version | State |
|---|---|
| `0.1.5-rc.2` | Verified — end-to-end acceptance: edit, retry, reading branches back after a restart, nested markers and image retention |
| `0.1.7-rc.1` | Verified — the same host-side acceptance; the client speaks both generations of the session-navigation API |
| `0.1.5-rc.3` and other `0.1.x` | Inside the same `engines` range, not verified on its own |
| `0.2.x` | Outside the range — try it, and please open an issue if something breaks |

When the host moves to a new line, run the acceptance in CI's host matrix first, then change the range — that matrix lists exactly the two verified versions above.

**The client stops for one thing only**: `slots` (without it there is nothing to register into). Everything else is taken on a "use it if it is there" basis: both generations of session navigation are understood (0.1.7's `uiWorkspace.openSession` and the older `sessions.open`), the session list and the locale pack come in through optional injection, and the subagent catalogue is read from either generation's field. A host that renames or drops one of those loses that one ability; it does not make the plugin install itself invisibly.

## Relationship to upstream

This repository is a fork of [dsh-plugin-message-edit](https://github.com/SpookySandwich/dsh-plugin-message-edit), which supplies the host-side branching engine (itself built on [dsh-message-edit](https://github.com/Moeblack/dsh-message-edit)). The emphasis differs: upstream is a "edit message" plugin, while this fork takes "where do the versions made by editing live" as the main problem — hence the tree, the slot swap and folding.

Both can coexist: the row id (`tree-view`) and the HTTP route (`/tree-view`) are its own, while the **durable event type stays upstream's `message-tree/version`**, so a session already branched upstream still reads as a tree here, with no data migration. Installing this without upstream is fine — upstream is not a dependency.

## FAQ

**Will it make a mess of my sessions?**
No. Editing only produces a new version, the original is never rewritten, and nothing collects on your behalf — the sidebar changes only when you pick a version or press "collect every other branch".

**Where do the collected versions go?**
They are in the Tree tab; right-click and choose "back into the main chat" to return one to the sidebar, or unarchive it from DSH's own archive list.

**Can I have several branches running at once?**
Yes. Every version is an independent session — put each one back into the main chat and they run in parallel; collect them into the tree again when you are done.

**What about very large families?**
Folding exists for that: the threshold can be set to Never, and any run can be folded or unfolded by hand. Either way the view re-frames itself once — a single click can add or remove hundreds of cards, and hunting for the tree with ⌖ is not the reader's job.

**Do conversations branched with DSH's own button show up in the tree?**
Yes. They are history-seeded sessions too, so the plugin derives the fork point from the seed length and draws them as a version on that line. DSH itself limits that button to the last message of a completed turn; the plugin does not change that.

**Which DSH versions are supported?**
See "Versions and compatibility". `engines.dsh` declares `>=0.1.5-rc.2 <0.1.6-0`, and `0.1.5-rc.2` is the one verified inside it. Restart DSH after updating the plugin.

## Settings

Settings → **TreeView**, five rows, each described in the panel:

| Setting | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Message control style | `DeepSeek` | `ChatGPT` / `DeepSeek` / `Claude` button layouts, previewed live in the panel. |
| Open the version I was last reading | `off` | See "Resume where you left off". |
| Stop the reply that is still being written | `on` | Stop every running reply in the same family (other versions included) before branching, saving quota — and letting you edit mid-reply. |
| Hide forks with no new turns | `on` | See "Hiding empty forks". |
| Fold long straight stretches | `2 turns and up` | `Never` / `2` / `5` / `8` / `12` / `20`, counted per run. A tagged turn and the one you are reading are never folded away — see "Folding". |

## For developers

<details>
<summary>Route, event and file layout</summary>

One route, registered by the host half:

```
GET  /tree-view?sessionId=…   read the family: the DAG, turn boundaries, archive state, what is running
POST /tree-view               build a branch (truncate → write the marker → create the agent → send the edited prompt)
POST /tree-view  action=…     activate · label · promote · demote · demoteOthers
```

The durable event written when branching is `message-tree/version`, carrying the `ignorable: true` envelope flag — without it the reader refuses to interpret the whole log and the session will not open at all.

```
lib/index.js            host half — route / branch transactions / family walk
lib/tree-logic.js       tree building and layout (pure, shared by host and client)
lib/tree-state.js       sidecar for branch names and archive ownership
lib/session-record.js   reads every version's record into one shape
lib/archive-adapter.js  the only hard coupling to host archiving
plugin.client.js        client half (source)
lib/client.js           client half (bundle, built by scripts/build-client.mjs)
test/                   16 behavioural test files
docs/                   architecture / tree data model / development
```

The host half does not hot-reload (editing `lib/index.js` needs a profile restart); the client half just needs a refresh.
